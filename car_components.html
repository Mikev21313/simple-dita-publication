            <p class="p">The powertrain is responsible for generating power and delivering it to the wheels:</p>
            <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Engine</strong>: Converts fuel into mechanical energy through combustion or electrical energy conversion. Types include internal combustion (gasoline/diesel), hybrid, and fully electric.</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Transmission</strong>: Transfers power from the engine to the wheels while allowing gear ratio changes. Types include manual, automatic, continuously variable (CVT), and dual-clutch.</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Driveshaft</strong>: Connects the transmission to the differential, transferring rotational power in rear-wheel and all-wheel drive vehicles.</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Differential</strong>: Allows wheels to rotate at different speeds when turning while transferring power from the driveshaft to the axles.</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Axles</strong>: Connect the wheels to the differential and support the vehicle's weight.</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Chassis and Suspension</h2>
            
            <p class="p">The foundation and support structure of the vehicle:</p>
            <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Frame/Chassis</strong>: The structural framework that supports all vehicle components. Modern passenger vehicles typically use unibody construction where the body and frame are integrated.</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Suspension System</strong>: Connects the vehicle to its wheels, providing support, stability, and isolating the vehicle from road imperfections. Common types include MacPherson strut, double wishbone, multi-link, and solid axle.</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Steering System</strong>: Allows the driver to control the vehicle's direction. Modern vehicles typically use rack-and-pinion steering, often with power or electric assistance.</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Braking System</strong>: Slows and stops the vehicle through friction. Components include master cylinder, brake lines, calipers/wheel cylinders, and friction materials (pads/shoes).</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Wheels and Tires</strong>: The contact point between the vehicle and the road, providing traction and absorbing minor road imperfections.</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Electrical and Electronic Systems</h2>
            
            <p class="p">Provides power and controls for various vehicle functions:</p>
            <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Battery</strong>: Stores electrical energy for starting the engine and powering electrical systems when the engine is off.</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Alternator</strong>: Generates electrical power while the engine is running to recharge the battery and power electrical systems.</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Starter Motor</strong>: Initiates engine operation by turning the crankshaft.</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Engine Control Module (ECM)</strong>: The main computer that manages engine operation, fuel delivery, and emissions.</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Body Control Module (BCM)</strong>: Controls body-related functions like lighting, power windows, and door locks.</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Sensors</strong>: Provide input data to various control modules about vehicle operation and conditions.</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Wiring Harness</strong>: The network of wires that connects all electrical components.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="p">The visible structure and passenger accommodation:</p>
            <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Body Panels</strong>: Exterior sheets forming the vehicle's visible structure, including hood, doors, fenders, and roof.</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Safety Structures</strong>: Crumple zones, impact beams, and reinforcements designed to protect occupants in collisions.</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Seating</strong>: Driver and passenger accommodation with adjustment mechanisms.</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Dashboard/Instrument Panel</strong>: Houses controls, displays, and air vents.</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Climate Control System</strong>: Maintains interior temperature and air quality through heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC).</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Infotainment System</strong>: Provides entertainment, navigation, and connectivity functions.</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Safety Systems</strong>: Airbags, seat belts, and active safety technologies designed to prevent accidents or protect occupants.</li>
