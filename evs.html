            <p class="p">An Electric Vehicle (EV) is an automobile that uses one or more electric motors for propulsion, powered by energy stored in rechargeable batteries, instead of an internal combustion engine.</p>
            <p class="p">Key characteristics of electric vehicles include:</p>
            <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">Zero tailpipe emissions during operation</li>
                <li class="li">Electric motor propulsion instead of internal combustion engine</li>
                <li class="li">Battery pack for energy storage</li>
                <li class="li">Regenerative braking to recover energy during deceleration</li>
                <li class="li">Instant torque delivery from electric motors</li>
                <li class="li">Significantly fewer moving parts than conventional vehicles</li>
                <li class="li">Lower operating noise levels</li>
                <li class="li">Charging capability instead of refueling</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Types of Electric Vehicles</h2>
            
            <p class="p">Electric vehicles are categorized based on their degree of electrification:</p>
            <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)</strong>: Fully electric vehicles powered exclusively by electricity stored in battery packs, with no internal combustion engine (e.g., Tesla Model 3, Nissan Leaf).</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs)</strong>: Combine an internal combustion engine with an electric motor and battery that can be charged from an external power source. Can operate in electric-only mode for limited range (e.g., Toyota RAV4 Prime, BMW 330e).</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs)</strong>: Use both an internal combustion engine and electric motor, but cannot be plugged in. Batteries are charged through regenerative braking and by the internal combustion engine (e.g., Toyota Prius, Honda Insight).</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs)</strong>: Use hydrogen fuel cells to generate electricity that powers an electric motor. Emit only water vapor as a byproduct (e.g., Toyota Mirai, Hyundai Nexo).</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Key Components</h2>
            
            <p class="p">Electric vehicles contain several specialized components:</p>
            <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Battery Pack</strong>: Large array of lithium-ion cells that store electrical energy, typically located in the vehicle floor for optimal weight distribution.</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Electric Motor(s)</strong>: Convert electrical energy into mechanical energy to drive the wheels. May use AC induction motors or permanent magnet synchronous motors.</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Power Electronics Controller</strong>: Manages the flow of electrical energy between the battery and motor(s), controlling speed and torque.</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Onboard Charger</strong>: Converts AC power from the grid to DC power for charging the battery.</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Thermal Management System</strong>: Maintains optimal battery temperature for performance and longevity.</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Regenerative Braking System</strong>: Recovers kinetic energy during deceleration, converting it back to electricity.</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">DC Fast Charging Port</strong>: Allows for rapid charging at public charging stations (in addition to standard charging ports).</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Charging Infrastructure</h2>
            
            <p class="p">Electric vehicles can be charged through various methods:</p>
            <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Level 1 Charging</strong>: Uses standard 120V household outlet. Slowest charging method providing approximately 3-5 miles of range per hour.</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Level 2 Charging</strong>: Uses 240V outlet or dedicated charging station. Provides approximately 15-40 miles of range per hour, depending on the vehicle and charger.</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">DC Fast Charging</strong>: Uses specialized high-powered charging stations that provide DC power directly to the battery. Can charge to 80% in 20-60 minutes depending on the vehicle and charger.</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Charging Networks</strong>: Commercial networks of charging stations available for public use, often requiring membership or payment (e.g., Tesla Supercharger, Electrify America, ChargePoint).</li>
            </ul>
