<h1>Essential Car Components</h1>
<p>Understanding the major components of your vehicle helps you communicate effectively with mechanics and make informed maintenance decisions.</p>


<h2>Engine and Powertrain</h2>
<p>The powertrain is responsible for generating power and delivering it to the wheels, enabling your vehicle to move forward and backward.</p>

<h3>Engine</h3>
<p>The heart of your vehicle, the engine converts fuel into mechanical energy through controlled combustion. Modern engines are typically four-cylinder, six-cylinder, or eight-cylinder configurations, each offering different balances of power and fuel efficiency.</p>

<h3>Transmission</h3>
<p>Transfers power from the engine to the wheels while allowing gear changes. Types include manual, automatic, continuously variable (CVT), and dual-clutch transmission systems.</p>

<h3>Drivetrain</h3>
<p>Connects the transmission to the differential, transferring rotational power to rear-wheel and all-wheel drive vehicles.</p>

<h3>Differential</h3>
<p>Allows wheels to rotate at different speeds when turning while transferring power from the drivetrain to the axles.</p>

<h3>Axles</h3>
<p>Connect the wheels to the differential and support the vehicle's weight.</p>

<h2>Chassis and Suspension</h2>
<p>The foundation and support structure of the vehicle.</p>

<h3>Frame/Chassis</h3>
<p>The structural framework that supports all vehicle components. Modern passenger vehicles typically use unibody construction where the body and frame are integrated.</p>

<h3>Suspension System</h3>
<p>Connects the vehicle to its wheels, providing support, stability, and isolating the vehicle from road imperfections. Common types include MacPherson strut, double wishbone, multi-link, and solid axle configurations.</p>

<h3>Steering System</h3>
<p>Allows the driver to control the vehicle's direction. Modern vehicles typically use rack-and-pinion steering, often with power or electric assistance.</p>

<h3>Braking System</h3>
<p>Slows and stops the vehicle through friction. Components include master cylinder, brake lines, calipers, wheel cylinders, and friction materials (pads/shoes).</p>

<h3>Wheels and Tires</h3>
<p>The contact point between the vehicle and the road, providing traction and absorbing minor road imperfections.</p>

<h2>Electrical and Electronic Systems</h2>
<p>Provides power and controls for various vehicle functions.</p>

<h3>Battery</h3>
<p>Stores electrical energy for starting the engine and powering electrical systems when the engine is off.</p>

<h3>Alternator</h3>
<p>Generates electrical power while the engine is running to recharge the battery and power electrical systems.</p>

<h3>Starter Motor</h3>
<p>Initiates engine operation by turning the crankshaft.</p>
