<h1>Essential Vehicle Maintenance</h1>
<p>Regular maintenance is crucial for vehicle safety, reliability, and longevity. Following these guidelines will help prevent costly repairs and ensure your vehicle operates at peak efficiency.</p>



<h2>Engine Oil and Filter Changes</h2>
<p>Engine oil lubricates moving parts, reduces friction, and helps regulate engine temperature. Modern vehicles typically require oil changes every 5,000-7,500 miles, though severe driving conditions may require more frequent service.</p>

<h3>Oil Change Intervals by Vehicle Type:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Conventional Oil:</strong> Every 3,000-5,000 miles</li>
  <li><strong>High-Mileage Oil:</strong> Every 5,000-7,500 miles</li>
  <li><strong>Synthetic Blend:</strong> Every 5,000-7,500 miles</li>
  <li><strong>Full Synthetic:</strong> Every 7,500-10,000 miles</li>
</ul>

<p>Always replace the oil filter with each oil change to ensure maximum filtration efficiency and engine protection.</p>

<h2>Tire Care and Maintenance</h2>
<p>Proper tire maintenance improves fuel efficiency, extends tire life, and ensures safe handling. Check tire pressure monthly using a reliable gauge, as underinflated tires can reduce fuel economy by up to 3%.</p>

<h3>Tire Maintenance Schedule:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Pressure Check:</strong> Monthly, including spare tire</li>
  <li><strong>Tire Rotation:</strong> Every 6,000-8,000 miles</li>
  <li><strong>Wheel Alignment:</strong> Annually or when uneven wear is noticed</li>
  <li><strong>Tire Replacement:</strong> When tread depth reaches 2/32 inch</li>
</ul>

<h2>Brake System Inspection</h2>
<p>Your braking system is critical for safety and should be inspected regularly. Warning signs include squealing noises, grinding sounds, vibration during braking, or a spongy brake pedal feel.</p>

<h3>Brake Component Replacement Intervals:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Brake Pads:</strong> Every 25,000-70,000 miles (varies by driving style)</li>
  <li><strong>Brake Rotors:</strong> Every 50,000-100,000 miles</li>
  <li><strong>Brake Fluid:</strong> Every 2-3 years or 24,000-36,000 miles</li>
  <li><strong>Brake Lines:</strong> Inspect annually for corrosion or damage</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cooling System Maintenance</h2>
<p>The cooling system prevents engine overheating by circulating coolant through the engine and radiator. Regular maintenance prevents costly engine damage from overheating.</p>

<p><strong>Coolant Replacement:</strong> Every 30,000-50,000 miles or as specified in your owner's manual. Use only the coolant type recommended by your vehicle manufacturer to prevent system damage.</p>

<h2>Air Filter Replacement</h2>
<p>A clean air filter ensures proper air flow to the engine, improving performance and fuel efficiency. A dirty filter can reduce acceleration and increase fuel consumption.</p>

<p><strong>Replacement Schedule:</strong> Every 12,000-15,000 miles under normal conditions, or more frequently in dusty environments.</p>

<h2>Professional Inspection Recommendations</h2>
<p>While many maintenance tasks can be performed by vehicle owners, certain inspections and services require professional expertise:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Annual comprehensive safety inspection</li>
  <li>Transmission service every 60,000-100,000 miles</li>
  <li>Timing belt replacement (if equipped) every 60,000-105,000 miles</li>
  <li>Spark plug replacement every 30,000-100,000 miles</li>
</ul>
