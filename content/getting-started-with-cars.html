<h2>Essential Knowledge for New Car Owners</h2>
<p>Owning a car comes with responsibilities that extend beyond just driving. Understanding your vehicle's basic systems and maintenance requirements will help ensure safe, reliable transportation and can save you money in the long run.</p>

<h3>Understanding Your Dashboard</h3>
<p>Your dashboard contains crucial warning lights and gauges that communicate your vehicle's status. Learn to recognize the check engine light, oil pressure warning, battery indicator, and temperature gauge. These indicators can alert you to potential problems before they become major repairs.</p>

<h3>Basic Maintenance Schedule</h3>
<p>Regular maintenance is the key to vehicle longevity. Most manufacturers recommend oil changes every 3,000-7,500 miles depending on your vehicle and driving conditions. Additionally, consider the following maintenance items:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tire rotation and pressure checks every 5,000-7,500 miles</li>
  <li>Air filter replacement every 12,000-15,000 miles</li>
  <li>Brake inspection annually or every 12,000 miles</li>
  <li>Coolant system flush every 30,000 miles</li>
  <li>Transmission service every 60,000-100,000 miles</li>
</ul>

<h3>Emergency Preparedness</h3>
<p>Every vehicle should be equipped with emergency supplies including jumper cables, a spare tire with proper tools, emergency flares or reflectors, and a first aid kit. Knowing how to change a tire and jump-start a battery can save you time and money in emergency situations.</p>

<p>Remember: When in doubt, consult your owner's manual or a qualified automotive professional. Proper maintenance and care will keep your vehicle running safely for years to come.</p>
