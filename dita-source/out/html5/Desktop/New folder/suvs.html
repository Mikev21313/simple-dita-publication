        <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Definition and Characteristics</h2>
            
            <p class="p">A Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV) combines elements of road-going passenger cars with features from off-road vehicles such as increased ground clearance and available four-wheel drive.</p>
            <p class="p">Key characteristics of SUVs include:</p>
            <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">Higher ground clearance than passenger cars</li>
                <li class="li">More upright seating position and taller roof</li>
                <li class="li">Available all-wheel drive (AWD) or four-wheel drive (4WD)</li>
                <li class="li">Two or three rows of seating</li>
                <li class="li">Either body-on-frame construction (traditional) or unibody construction (crossovers)</li>
                <li class="li">Larger cargo capacity compared to sedans</li>
                <li class="li">Usually featuring a rear hatch rather than a trunk</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">SUV Categories</h2>
            
            <p class="p">SUVs are typically classified into the following categories based on size and construction:</p>
            <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Subcompact Crossovers</strong>: Smallest SUV category, based on subcompact car platforms (e.g., Honda HR-V, Toyota C-HR)</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Compact SUVs/Crossovers</strong>: Most popular segment, balancing utility and efficiency (e.g., Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V)</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Mid-size SUVs</strong>: Larger two or three-row SUVs (e.g., Toyota Highlander, Ford Explorer)</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Full-size SUVs</strong>: Largest SUVs, often built on truck platforms (e.g., Chevrolet Tahoe, Ford Expedition)</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Luxury SUVs</strong>: Premium features and materials across various size categories (e.g., Range Rover, BMW X5)</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Off-road SUVs</strong>: Specialized for off-road capability (e.g., Jeep Wrangler, Toyota 4Runner)</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Construction Types</h2>
            
            <p class="p">SUVs generally fall into two construction categories:</p>
            <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Body-on-Frame</strong>: Traditional SUV construction where the body is mounted on a separate ladder frame, similar to trucks. Provides greater towing capacity, durability for off-road use, and greater isolation from road imperfections. Examples include Toyota 4Runner, Chevrolet Tahoe.</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Unibody (Monocoque)</strong>: Also called crossovers, these integrate the body and frame into a single unit, similar to passenger cars. Offers better fuel efficiency, handling, and ride comfort at the expense of some ruggedness. Examples include Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Drivetrain Options</h2>
            
            <p class="p">SUVs offer various drivetrain configurations:</p>
            <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Front-Wheel Drive (FWD)</strong>: Common in crossovers, providing better fuel economy but limited off-road capability.</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Rear-Wheel Drive (RWD)</strong>: Primarily in larger, truck-based SUVs, offering better towing dynamics.</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">All-Wheel Drive (AWD)</strong>: System that automatically sends power to all four wheels as needed for traction, primarily designed for on-road use in varying weather conditions.</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Four-Wheel Drive (4WD)</strong>: More robust system designed for off-road use, often featuring low-range gearing and selectable modes.</li>
            </ul>
