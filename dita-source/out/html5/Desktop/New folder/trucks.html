        <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Definition and Characteristics</h2>
            
            <p class="p">A truck is a motor vehicle designed primarily for transporting cargo, with an open cargo area known as a bed, separated from the cab where the driver sits.</p>
            <p class="p">Key characteristics of trucks include:</p>
            <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">Body-on-frame construction for durability and load capacity</li>
                <li class="li">Open cargo bed behind the passenger cabin</li>
                <li class="li">Higher ground clearance than passenger vehicles</li>
                <li class="li">Rear-wheel drive, four-wheel drive, or all-wheel drive configurations</li>
                <li class="li">Higher towing and payload capacities compared to other vehicle types</li>
                <li class="li">Typically designed for utility and durability over comfort</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Bed Configurations</h2>
            
            <p class="p">Pickup truck beds come in various lengths and styles:</p>
            <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Short Bed</strong>: Typically 5.5 to 5.8 feet</li>
